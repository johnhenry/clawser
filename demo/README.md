# demo/

Historical Rust demo binaries from the original Rust/WASM architecture. These were created before the transition to pure JavaScript and are **likely non-functional** with the current codebase.

These files are kept as reference only. The current Clawser runtime is pure JavaScript — see the `web/` directory.
